This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
## TODO
- change github login callback to deployment url instead of localhost
- authguard actual app instead of just homepage
- to make the app more clean:
  - extract business logic from cards 
  - move URLs to env variables
- consider cleaning up error/not-found/loading files etc

## Deployment
https://next13-myspace-mircosteyer.vercel.app/

Uses neon.tech for Postgres Database.
